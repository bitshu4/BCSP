# BCSP for Slope Plus
Have you ever played *The Battle Cats*? If you haven't, I highly recommend it. But have you ever played *Slope Plus* and wanted some *The Battle Cats* at the same time? No one has ever wanted that. But I wanted that, so I made **BCSP**, **B**attle **C**ats in **S**lope **P**lus!

This mod adds the menu theme from *The Battle Cats* into your game, adds other *The Battle Cats* sound effects and even adds the splash text cat from the menu! If you're ever feeling down, just click on the speech bubble and be entertained! Hopefully.
